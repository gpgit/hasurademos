* What We Will Cover

- What is GraphQL?
- What is Hasura?
- How do we use them?
- How do we use them well?
- What are the general principles?
- What are the particular details?
- What is the proper mental model?
- How do we get there?

* What is GraphQL?

#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class="column" style="float:left; width:60%">

- Query Language
- /Development/ Tool
- Schema
  - Types
    - Fields
- Types relate to Types
- Sound familiar?

* What is Hasura?

- API Server :: run-time network server
- Compiler :: run-time GQL to SQL
- IDE :: dev-time authoring environment

* How do we use them?

- Build network applications /*faster*/, more /*reliably*/, and /*cheaper*/ with GraphQL.
- Build GraphQL applications /*faster*/, more /*reliably*/, and /*cheaper*/ with Hasura.
- Apply the general principles with training from /*Hasura Solutions Architects*/.
- Apply the particular details with support from /*Hasura Support Engineering*/.

* How do we use them well?

- Adopt a principled approach.
- Develop a proper mental model.

* What are the general principles?

1. Build for /humans/.
2. Build with /personas/.
3. Build /in/ the database.
4. Build a /data model/.
5. /Remember/ OLTP vs OLAP.

* What is the proper mental model?

- Hasura ~graphql-engine~ is the API server, is on the data plane, and is on the critical path.
- Hasura ~console~ is part of the development environment, is on the control plane, and is off the critical path.
- Hasura ~CLI~ is part of the development environment, is on the control plane, and is far off the critical path.

* What is the proper mental model?

- The key /functional/ concerns are: data modeling, API development, business logic, authorization, and integration.
- The key /non-functional/ concerns are: deployment, caching, monitoring, performance, and security.

* How do we get there?

- Track 1: Development
- Track 2: Deployment

* Track 1: Development

- [X] Setup: data-sources
- [X] Tables and Relationships: data modeling
- [X] Customization: GraphQL API development

* Track 1: Development

- [X] Events: async integration for side-effects
- [X] Actions: synced integration with REST
- [X] Actions: integration with REST
- [X] Remote Schema: integration with GraphQL
- [X] REST Endpoints: REST APIs
- [X] Authorization: business logic

* Track 2: Deployment

- [X] Self-Hosted vs Cloud
- [X] Development Environment
- [X] Development Workflow (CI/CD)
- [X] Security: API Limits
- [X] Monitoring
- [X] Performance: Read-replicas
- [X] Caching: Redis
- [X] Authentication
